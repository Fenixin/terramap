This is a simple map generator for Terraria. It works with version 1.1.1.

It uses PIL to draw a black and white representation of a Terraria world.
Colours aren't supported yet.

Instantiate the world object, passing it the paths to the world file and the
tiles.csv file, respectively. Then call draw_map(), passing it the path to the
output file.
